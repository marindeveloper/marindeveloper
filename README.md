# what's up
I've been programming for about 3 years now. I started programming because of Discord, more specifically the people I met on there who introduced me to it. Since then I've learned Java, HTML, CSS, a little bit of MySQL and I'm currently learning JS and have made a few projects using it which you can check out below.

Outside of coding, I’m into photography and gaming. I usually play competitive stuff like CS2 but also enjoy story or cozy games a lot. (A Short Hike, Firewatch, Undertale and Deltarune were great games)

Oh yeah I'm also into undertale speedrunning now for some reason

:D
