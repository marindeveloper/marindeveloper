# what's up
I like programming, photography and a lot of other random shit. I've been programming for about 3 years now. I started programming because of Discord, more specifically the people I met on there who introduced me to it. Initially started by making a pretty shit Discord bot with Node.JS, then went to Java and back end devlopment, and lastly learned some web development. I'm currently learning JS and have made a few projects using it.

Outside of coding, Iâ€™m into photography and gaming. I usually play competitive stuff like CS2 but also enjoy story or cozy games a lot.
